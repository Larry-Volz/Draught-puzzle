Draught Puzzle - JS, JQuery, HTML, CSS
This is a simple puzzle I made while I was learning JQuery & CSS styling.  It works well although could use a game loop
win sequnce and that kind of thing for polishing.  
The objective is to move the green circles to where the red squares were and the red squares to where the green circles
were. 
They can move to an empty spot directly or they can jump the object next to them if there is a blank spot on the other side
(like checkers)
It IS possible to beat it. 
But it's NOT easy :)

To run it all you need to do is bring it up in a browser. 

Feel free to use it without license but an acknowledgement in the code is appreicated.
